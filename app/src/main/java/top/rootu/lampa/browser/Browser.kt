    /**
     * Injects the supplied Java object into this WebView. The object is
     * injected into all frames of the web page, including all the iframes,
     * using the supplied name. This allows the Java object's methods to be
     * accessed from JavaScript. For applications targeted to API
     * level [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR1]
     * and above, only public methods that are annotated with
     * [android.webkit.JavascriptInterface] can be accessed from JavaScript.
     * For applications targeted to API level [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN] or below,
     * all public methods (including the inherited ones) can be accessed, see the
     * important security note below for implications.
     *
     *  Note that injected objects will not appear in JavaScript until the page is next
     * (re)loaded. JavaScript should be enabled before injecting the object. For example:
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     * class JsObject {
     * @JavascriptInterface
     * @org.xwalk.core.JavascriptInterface
     * public String toString() { return "injectedObject"; }
     * }
     * webview.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
     * webView.addJavascriptInterface(new JsObject(), "injectedObject");
     * webView.loadData(" <title></title>", "text/html", null);
     * webView.loadUrl("javascript:alert(injectedObject.toString())");</pre>
     *
     *
     * **IMPORTANT:**
     *
     *  *  This method can be used to allow JavaScript to control the host
     * application. This is a powerful feature, but also presents a security
     * risk for apps targeting [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN] or earlier.
     * Apps that target a version later than [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN]
     * are still vulnerable if the app runs on a device running Android earlier than 4.2.
     * The most secure way to use this method is to target [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.JELLY_BEAN_MR1]
     * and to ensure the method is called only when running on Android 4.2 or later.
     * With these older versions, JavaScript could use reflection to access an
     * injected object's public fields. Use of this method in a WebView
     * containing untrusted content could allow an attacker to manipulate the
     * host application in unintended ways, executing Java code with the
     * permissions of the host application. Use extreme care when using this
     * method in a WebView which could contain untrusted content.
     *  *  JavaScript interacts with Java object on a private, background
     * thread of this WebView. Care is therefore required to maintain thread
     * safety.
     *
     *  *  Because the object is exposed to all the frames, any frame could
     * obtain the object name and call methods on it. There is no way to tell the
     * calling frame's origin from the app side, so the app must not assume that
     * the caller is trustworthy unless the app can guarantee that no third party
     * content is ever loaded into the WebView even inside an iframe.
     *  *  The Java object's fields are not accessible.
     *  *  For applications targeted to API level [android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP]
     * and above, methods of injected Java objects are enumerable from
     * JavaScript.
     *
     *
     * @param jsObject the Java/Kotlin object to inject into this WebView's JavaScript
     * context. `null` values are ignored.
